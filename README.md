# titanic
ongoing kaggle titanic attempt (fun)

Have basics down for attempt
todos:
a) refactor titanic.py for readability
b) create adversarial validation class (ideally sklearn compatiable)
c) incorporate auto machine learning process with validation
d) output of (c) should be good to go, engouh to consider this repo mostly done
e) might spin out adversarial validation class into sckit-contrib to help with data shift cases
